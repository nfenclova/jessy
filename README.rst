jessy
=====

``jessy`` is a kernel for *IntelÂ® 64-bit* CPUs, written in modern C++ with
a minimal amount of assembler. The goal of ``jessy`` is to provide a safe and
efficient base for custom/experimental operating systems, leveraging the full
feature-set of the C++ programming language.

Building
========

``jessy`` relies on modern C++ features (*ISO14882:2017* and later).
Development primarily happens in a Linux environment. This section
documents the software requirements and steps to build ``jessy``.

Requirements
------------

This section lists the software required to build ``jessy``, together with the
minimum (tested) version and packages for (tested) Linux distributions.

Bootstrapping and Building
--------------------------

This section outlines the steps required to bootstrap a ``jessy`` development
and build environment, as well as how to get ``jessy`` running in *QEMU*.

Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install the required software outlined above
2. ``git clone`` this repository:

   * read-only: ``git clone https://github.com/nfenclova/jessy``
   * read-write: ``git clone git@github.com:nfenclova/jessy``

Build Environment and First Boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open a shell
2. Change your working directory to the root of your clone. E.g.
   ``cd ~/git/jessy``
3. Bootstrap the build environment and perform the initial build:
   ``./support/tools/build.sh``
4. Change your working directory to the ``build`` folder in the root of your
   clone. E.g. ``cd build``
5. Start ``jessy`` in *QEMU*: ``cmake --build . --target boot``
